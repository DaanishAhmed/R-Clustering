K-Means Clustering on Leaf Species Data
----------------

This project involves using R to examine a dataset containing leaf species information.  My goal is to categorize leaf specimens into their correct species based on their characteristics.  I will do this by using k-means clustering, an unsupervised classification method that finds shared characteristics between cases and groups them into appropriate clusters.

The full report can be found in the file "K-Means Clustering.pdf".  This report shows a complete breakdown of my analysis, including problem identification, motivation, data exploration, data preparation, model creation, model results, model tuning, and proposed solutions.  Tables, visualizations, and a copy of my code are included in the appendices.

The dataset "leaf.csv" was created by Silva, Marcal, and Almeida da Silva (2014).  It can be found at the UCI Machine Learning Repository, along with the data description:

The R script is included in the file "clustering script.R".  The requirements are described in the file "requirements.txt".  Instructions on how to use the program are included as comments in the R file.  After opening the file, please read the instructions carefully before executing the code to ensure that the program functions correctly.
